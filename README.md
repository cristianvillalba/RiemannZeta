# Riemann Zeta Function Viewer

Riemann Zeta viewer made with JmonkeyEngine

This app will calculate the Z Riemann Function in a region in the complex plane, and render that to a texture, which you can later export to a PNG file.
The app is applying domain coloring to make the output prettier.

It is also capable to store zeta values in a CSV file.

Best regards,
